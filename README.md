# Neovim configuration

Here's my personal configuration when using Neovim.

All files are supposed to be in the configuration file for Neovim (`nvim`).

Packer needs to be cloned into the .config directory, like so:
 ```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim
```

Then shout out the packer.lua file, and then do ```:PackerSync``` from NeoVim.
